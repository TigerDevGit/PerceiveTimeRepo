            Building a basic Excel timesheet for your employees is simple. Follow the steps below for a timesheet your staff could use over and over.

          <h2 class="top-margin-15"><span>1. Define</span> your labels and categories</h2>
          <p>
            Figure out what kind of information you actually need to have on your timesheets. Typically you would need employee name, time period the timesheet covers (week, month), but also the name of department & manager.
          </p>
          <p>
            Of course, you can also add the social security number, employee ID if needed - but simpler is better.

          <p>
            Weâ€™re using morning and afternoon separately, because your employees will have a lunch break in the middle. Don't worry about adding up the total, that will be calculated automatically using a formula.

          <h2 class="top-margin-15"><span>3. Calulating</span> daily hours</h2>
          <p>
            In this example timesheet, we will only be using two basic formulas - one for adding up the total hours for a single day, and one for adding up all working hours for the period of the timesheet.
          </p>
            To add up the day's hours, we inserted a simple =SUM(B7+D7) formula into the "Total hours" cell (E7 in our example). Once an employee has entered their hours in the "morning" and "afternoon" cells, they will be automatically added up in the "total" field. To use the same formula for the other days, simply copy the formula, and select "paste formula" in the other fields below the original one - Excel will change the values for the other fields for you, so no need for manual typing.

          <h2 class="top-margin-25"><span>4. Calculating</span> total weekly hours</h2>
          <p>
            To get the total hours your employee worked in a week, we will need to add up the individual daily total hours. This can be done easily by selecting a field where you want the total hours to be displayed and inserting another SUM formula.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example in this picture, working days for the week start at row number 3 and end in row number 8 and the daily totals are displayed in column D. To get the weekly total, the formula would be =SUM(E7:E11). This means that Excel will automatically add up all values in column D that fall between rows 3 and 8.

          <h2 class="top-margin-15"><span>5. Locking</span> the timesheet</h2>
          <p>
            To avoid accidents and mistakes, you will definitely want your employees to edit the cells where they need to insert their working hours, but to make things easier for yourself, you can also give them the option to edit their name and timesheet time range. To do this you need to define unlocked cells.
          </p>
            By default, all cells in Excel are set as "locked" - to unlock the fields you want your employees to edit, drag and select the cells. Select "format cells" and go to the "Protection" tab - there, untick the checkbox where it says "locked". 
          </p>
          <p>
            Once you have done that, move on to the next step.

          <h2 class="top-margin-25"><span>6. Prevent</span> future editing</h2>
          <p>
            Once you have unlocked the cells you need your employees to edit, head to the "Format" menu and select "protect sheet". Only tick the box where it says "select unlocked cells".
          </p>
          <p>
            When you've ticked the box, choose a password for unlocking the timesheet, hit "OK" and you're done!
          </p>
          <p>
            Simply copy the timesheet file and pass the copies on to your employees.
