            Great project management software is essential if you’re working on a collaborative effort. But projects don’t only cost money and effort - they also cost time.
          </p>
          <p>
            Having detailed knowledge of where your time is going is crucial to guaranteeing the sustainability of your projects, and your business as a whole. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Here we want to show you how you can take timesheets to a new level, by using Toggl to track your project collaborators’ time and how you can analyze that data to improve your collaborative processes.

          <h2><span>1. Categorize</span> your time</h2>
          <p>
            With Toggl, creating and managing different projects is pretty simple, but often you need to distinguish between different types of tasks within one single work project - especially if you have multiple people working on a joint collaborative effort.
          </p>
          <p>
            For collaboration to be effective, there has to be a clear division between different tasks. To address this problem, Toggl uses “tasks” - smaller chunks of work that can be created within projects, and assigned to different people. Tasks can also be given estimates to monitor their progress towards completion - which is especially useful if your team is working on a tight budget.

        <div class="col-1">
          <img src="images/landing-pages/timesheet-collaboration-02-monitoring-progress.jpg" alt="Monitor time spent on your projects" />
        </div>
        <div class="col-2">
          <h2><span>2. Monitor</span> your project progress</h2>
          <p>
            Once you have set up your projects and have your employees tracking their working hours, you will need a way to analyse the time data in a way that is both simple and detailed. These may sound ilke opposing ideas, but with Toggl they are not.
          </p>
          <p>
            For one, Toggl has different types of reports that enable the user to quickly access information about their team’s time spending in different forms. "Summary reports" are great for getting an overview of work done on different projects, while "detailed reports" allow the user to view and edit the individual pieces of work tracked.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Toggl Pro version adds a “Project Dashboard” functionality, allowing you to monitor progress on the smaller details that make up your projects. Imagine it as a highly interactive timesheet. It shows you a quick overview of how far the project is from completion based on your estimates and - if you’re using billable rates - how much money has been spent (or earned).

        <div class="col-1">
          <img src="images/landing-pages/timesheet-collaboration-03-analyzing-timesheets-data.jpg" alt="Analyzing the data on your timesheets" />
        </div>
        <div class="col-2">
          <h2><span>3. Share and analyze</span> your timesheet data</h2>
          <p>
            Communication is a central part of any collaboration - which is why sharing data about time usage with the relevant people has to be as efficient as possible. Toggl Pro offers the option to export your time tracking data into an Excel spreadsheet format. This is great if you want to set up some custom formulas for analysing your staff’s timesheets.
          </p>
          <p>
            While putting together progress reports and sharing them is crucial as far as effective teamwork is concerned, gathering all that data for analysis is a hugely time consuming task. Toggl solves that problem by allowing you to “bookmark” your reports.
          </p>
          <p>
            Essentially, you can use a wide variety of filters to put your data into a report. Once done, you can bookmark that report, so that it’s easier to compile it in the future. These bookmarked reports can also be used with people who are not using Toggl, making them great for sharing your project reports and timesheets with clients and external partners.
