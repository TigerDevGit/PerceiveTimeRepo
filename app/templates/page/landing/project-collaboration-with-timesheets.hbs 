            Data is only valuable when you know how to use it. The same goes for timesheets.
          </p>
          <p>
            One thing that makes Toggl a particularly useful time tracking tool, is its powerful reporting capabilities. All the time your employees record with Toggl is automatically filtered and can instantly be displayed as different types of reports. This takes online timesheets to a whole new level.
          </p>
          <p>
            Below we show you how Toggl can turn the information on your timesheets into actionable insight.

          <h2><span>1. Filtering</span> your timesheet data</h2>
          <p>
            What makes the Toggl time log system so powerful, is its ability to filter the time data. You can display in-depth reports for one or several different users, user groups, clients, projects or specific tasks. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Also, you can attach billable rates to different users and projects, in which case reports also display how much money was spent or earned from different activities. Users can also filter time logs by custom time ranges, meaning you can have a month's worth of data just as easily as a week's worth.

        <div class="col-2">
          <h2><span>2. Quickly see</span> what your team is doing</h2>
          <p>
            Summary reports are great for getting a quick overview of what your individual employees have spent their time on, how much time has been spent on different clients or how much time has been tracked under different projects in any given time period.
          </p>
          <p>
            The time data is presented in a colourful, easy-to-follow pie chart. You can also drill down into you preferred category to reveal additional details about your team's time spending.
          </p>

        </div>
        <div class="col-2">
          <h2><span>3. See & edit</span> detailed time logs</h2>
          <p>
            Detailed reports are especially useful if you need to see or edit people’s individual time entries. Again, filtering gives you lots of different options for displaying the time data.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once you select the desired time range and filters, you get a list of individual time entries. You can then delete entries you don’t want to see in your reports, or change different details about the entries. If you want to change more several entries at a time, you can do so with a “bulk edit” feature.

        </div>
        <div class="col-2">
          <h2 class="top-margin"><span>4. Weekly</span> collaborative timesheets</h2>
          <p>
            This report visually resembles traditional timesheets the most. Again, time tracking data can be filtered by the employee or user, project, client and task. Unlike, the two previous reporting types, these reports are confined to a weekly time range, which makes them very easy to fetch.
          </p>
          <p>
            Traditional timesheets only show you the time spent on work across a chosen week, but as with the other reports, you can quickly reorganize the sheet to look at daily time spending by users, projects and clients. It's a great way to get an easy overview of your office team's timesheets for a given week, but if you need more details, you can easily expand the chart with a single click.

        <div class="col-2">
          <h2><span>5. Sharing</span> your timesheets</h2>
          <p>
            Analyzing reports is important, but so is communication and sharing your insight. We’ve added several options for doing that.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you just want to share the data with others, you can bookmark your reports which lets easily and consistently share your data on a regular basis - even with people who are not using Toggl. All reports can also be downloaded as PDF files and printed.
          </p>
          <p>
            The options for exporting Excel and CSV files in turn, are great if you want to use the time tracking data from Toggl inside other applications, or if you want to do some additional timesheet calculations.
